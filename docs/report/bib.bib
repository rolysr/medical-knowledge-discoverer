	abstract = {The eHealth-KD 2021 is the automatic extraction of knowledge challenge from health documents written in Spanish with a small selection of sentences from diﬀerent domains and languages to encourage cross-lingual and transfer learning approaches, we use the pre-trained Language Model (LM), namely XML-RoBERTa-base, to provide a Crosslingual representation of tokens and the ability to transfer learning from general domains. Our group participated in all the proposed scenarios; the main one (F1 0.499), Entity Recognition (ER) (F1 0.653) and Relation Extraction (RE) (F1 0.430). The present system was designed as a pipeline of generic sequence labellers, each of them independently ﬁne-tuned for each subtask. The generic sequence labeller consists of a feed-forward network that learns how to align a sequence of tokens into a sequence of labels regardless of the language and domain. This simple straightforward system ranked in the third position in the main and Entity recognition scenario and widely outperformed the other systems in the relation extraction scenario.},

	title = {{UH}-{MMM} at {eHealth}-{KD} {Challenge} 202},
	abstract = {This paper explains the solution presented by the UH-MMM group to the eHealth-KD challenge at IberLEF 2021. Two main subtasks for knowledge discovery were deﬁned: entity recognition and relationship extraction. The evaluation of the task is divided into three scenarios: one corresponding to the detection of entities, one corresponding to the detection of relations between such pair of entities, and the third one corresponding to the extraction of both entities and relationships. For both subtasks, our proposal makes use of BiLSTM as contextual encoders and Dense layers as the tag decoder architecture of the model. In the challenge, the system ranked ﬁfth in the main scenario, fourth in the scenario evaluating the ﬁrst task, and ﬁfth in the last scenario. The score obtained in the relationship extraction task shows that the proposed approach needs to be further explored.},

	title = {Vicomtech at {eHealth}-{KD} {Challenge} 2021: {Deep} {Learning} {Approaches} to {Model} {Health}-related {Text} in {Spanish}},
	abstract = {This paper describes the participation of the Vicomtech NLP team in the eHealth-KD 2021 shared task about detecting and classifying entities and relations in health-related texts written in Spanish. We participate with two systems. Joint Classifier is a simpliﬁed version of the system that won the main scenario of the previous eHealth-KD edition. It consists of a single end-to-end deep neural network with pre-trained BERT models as the core for the semantic representation of the input texts, that predicts all the output variables—entities and relations—at the same time, modelling the whole problem jointly. The main change w.r.t. the original implementation aﬀects the representation of relations. The Joint Classifier model achieved the ﬁrst position in the main scenario of the competition and ranked second in the rest of the scenarios. The second submitted system, Seq2Seq, uses an approach based on an encoder-decoder model. It transduces the input text into an output sequence by reading the input text. The target sequence is a compact representation of the information contained in the gold-labels of the datasets. This approach showed a promising performance despite not being competitive enough. However, it poses an interesting potential future work.},
